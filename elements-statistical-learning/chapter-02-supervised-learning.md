# Introduction

1. **Inputs**
: set of variables that are measrured or preset. Also called *predictors*, *features* (in pattern recognition), and *independent variables*

2. **Outputs**: set of variables that are influenced by the *inputs*. Also called *responses* or *dependent variables*

3. **Supervised Learning**: an exercise where the goal is to use *inputs* to predict the value of the *outputs*


# Variable Types and Terminology

1. Types of Variables

  a. **Quantitative Variables**: variables that are numerical and represent a measurable quantity
  b. **Qualtitative Variables**: variables that are names of labels
    - Also referred to as *categorical* or *discrete* variables, or *factors*
    - Typically are represented by numerical codes (targets)
      - Binary cases are represented by 0 and 1
      - Dummy variables are used when there are mor than 2 categories
  c. Ordered Categorical: there is an ordering between the values but not metric notion is appropriate (the difference between two variables may not be the same as the difference between the next two set of variables i.e. small-medium and medium-large)

2. Prediction Tasks
  

  a. **Regression**: predict quantitative outputs
  b. **Classification**: predict qualitative outputs
