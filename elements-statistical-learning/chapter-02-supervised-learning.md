# Introduction

1. **Inputs**: set of variables that are measrured or preset. Also called *predictors*, *features* (in pattern recognition), and *independent variables*

2. **Outputs**: set of variables that are influenced by the *inputs*. Also called *responses* or *dependent variables*

3. **Supervised Learning**: an exercise where the goal is to use *inputs* to predict the value of the *outputs*
